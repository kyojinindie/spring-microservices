## What's a microservices?

A microservice is a small, loosely coupled, distributed service. The key concepts you need to embrace as you think about microservices are decomposing and unbundling.

A microservice architecture has the following characteristics:

Application logic is broken down into small-grained components with well-definend, coordinate boundaries of responsability.

Each component has a small domain of responsibility and is depolyed independenty of the others. A single microservice is responsible for one part of business domain.

Microservices employ lightweight communication protocols suxh as HTTP and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for exchamginh data between the sercixe consumer and service provider.

Because microservice appllicaions always communicate with a technology-neutral fomat (JSON is the most common), the underlying technical implementation of the service is irrelevant. This means tha an application buil ussing a microservice approach can be constructed with multiplr languages and technoloogies.

Microsercixes--by their small. independent , and distributed nature--allow organizations to have smaller development reams with well-defined areas of responsibiliyty. These teams might work toward a single goal,, such as delivering an application, but each team is respoinsible only for the services on which they're working.
